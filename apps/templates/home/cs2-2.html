            Often times, patients who use drugs might not be aware or ready to consider stopping their use.
For some, the negative consequences associated with their use have never been brought forward
to them and therefore they never considered it as an issue affecting their lives. For others, they
might recognize the problem, but might not know what concrete steps they can take to improve
their health or might not be ready for change. It is your job as a future physician to engage them
in compassionate and empathetic dialogue, such that you both can work to figure out what might
be most helpful to them at this stage in their decision-making process.

          <p class="card-text">
            If a patient is not ready to quit their use just yet, there are tangible ways you can support them.
This module will take a deeper dive into the utility of harm-reduction efforts. Harm reduction
aims to reduce the negative health and social consequences associated with drug use. Many of
these techniques can be integrated into clinical practice immediately.
