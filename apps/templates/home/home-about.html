                  <p class="card-text"> Medical clinicians are trained to identify and treat diseases. Physicians, in the spirit of the Hippocratic Oath, vow to use their ability and judgment to help the sick, regardless of whom the sick might be. Thus, it is often assumed that the professionals in the medical community hold unbiased attitudes toward their patients, including toward individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD).</p>
                  <p class="card-text"> It turns out that the opposite is true. Physicians often have worse attitudes toward individuals with substance use disorders (SUDs), more so than toward individuals with other medical and mental health diagnoses. Further, these attitudes may deteriorate over time. Those who have been practicing for longer have been shown to have even worse attitudes toward patients with SUDs, and the worst toward opioid use disorder. </p>

                                            addiction are generally as successful as those for other chronic diseases. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="card-text">According to the World Health Organization, drug addiction is the number one most stigmatized
                                            social problem, even over poverty, incarceration, homelessness, mental illness, and alcoholism.
                                            Defined as an attribute, behavior, or condition that is socially discrediting, stigma stands as one
                                            of the largest barriers to individual recovery. One way to prevent such destructiveness is to

                                            use lowers self-esteem, which in turn lowers self-efficacy, which then might lead one to relapse
                                            or initiate the use of substances. Stigma also decreases social support. If one is viewed as
                                            someone who has a lesser social value, people are less likely to help. In this vein, stigma also
                                            limits one's access to treatment. Many psychosocial treatment modalities target the foundation
                                            on which stigma might be perpetuated, such as interpersonal isolation and social punishment
                                            due to use.

                                        <p class="card-text">To explore this question, let's put substance use disorders in context. In 2020, 40.3 20.8 million
                                            Americans 12+ years old —approximately 6.5% of the population—met the criteria for a SUD in
                                            the past year. This was an increase of about 20 million from 2015. More specifically in 2020,
                                            28.3 million people met the criteria for an alcohol use disorder, and 18.4 million people had
                                            been diagnosed with an illicit drug use disorder. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="card-text">While these numbers are overwhelming, the numbers for overdose deaths are even more so. In
                                            the United States from 2001-2015, 530,000 people died from drug overdoses. Alarmingly,
                                            suicide tolls have been rising steadily as well. In short, SUDs impact many Americans, and
                                            nearly everyone knows someone who has been affected by the disorder. In addition, the
                                            magnitude of these disorders and death rates have resulted in significant impacts on society,
                                            including its economic well-being. Likewise, the strain on the healthcare system is felt even by
                                            those who do not have OUD.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="card-text">Research has consistently found that clinician' negative attitudes toward patients with OUD
                                            result in worse quality of care. Negative attitudes have been shown to manifest in clinicians'
                                            beliefs that the patients with OUD are manipulative, lack motivation, and are violent. In addition,
                                            empathy is a key element of effective medical care, and negative clinical attitudes almost
                                            always result in reduced empathy for patients. In short, patient-centered care models are
                                            enfeebled, and actual treatment outcomes deteriorate.

                                            senior residents. Post-graduate year (PGY) 3 or 4 residents had significantly worse attitudes
                                            toward patients with SUDs than did junior residents (PGY 1 or 2).

                                            students' attitudes toward those with SUDs to the attitudes held by members of the senior
                                            house staff. In line with our findings, the senior house staff held more negative attitudes toward
                                            individuals with SUDs than did the medical students. In other words, the most
                                            knowledgeable, successful, and highly-trained physicians had worse attitudes than their
                                            students.

                                        <p class="card-text">Likewise, research has found that feelings of satisfaction with working with individuals with
                                            SUDs decreased over years of training; at the same time, beliefs that individuals with SUDs
                                            were high utilizers of health care services increased.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="card-text">Given the overwhelming evidence of attitudinal negativity, we might wonder whether any
                                            physicians hold positive attitudes toward individuals with SUDs. It turns out that one subset, in
                                            particular, has less stigma toward individuals with SUDs: clinicians who have chosen to work
                                            with such patients. While this alone is interesting, more research is needed to determine which
                                            attributes and cognitions might distinguish these clinicians from their colleagues.

                                        <p class="card-text">Research has consistently found that clinicians' negative attitudes toward patients with SUDs
                                        result in worse quality of care. What contributes to such attitudes?
                                        One school of thought is that lack of education and knowledge on how to care for individuals
                                        with SUDs may lead to health care professionals' negative attitudes. As a result, medical
                                        schools and other training programs have increasingly added addiction education and skills to
                                        their curricula. These interventions, however, have not been sufficient to improve attitudes.
                                        That is, it appears that increasing knowledge through educational courses is helpful but not, in
                                        itself, a solution 
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="card-text">Addiction is often considered an illness characterized by “loss of free will”. In other words, the
                                        neurobiological systems become rewired to depend on the substance, in such a way that guides
                                        behaviors and cognitions to maintain usage at all costs, and it becomes very difficult to
                                        modulate over time. The brain circuits affected by addiction include those involved with impulse
                                        executive functioning (i.e. decision-making), control, memory, reward, and stress. Over time,
                                        there are changes in brain functioning which is the cause of one's risk In using substances or
                                        continuously craving it during recovery. This knowledge can help counteract the belief that
                                        individuals with addiction are choosing to engage in destructive behaviors. Viewing the illness
                                        as a medical disease promotes greater compassion for our patients.

                                    <p class="card-text">Clinicians tend to have few encounters with individuals with OUD who are in recovery. Unless
                                        they specialize in addiction, they encounter such patients when they are in acute use or
                                        withdrawal phases, and they often do not have sufficient time and resources to understand the
                                        person behind the disease. In short, they see only the difficult periods, and they do not see the
                                        successes. These negative encounters (and lack of positive encounters) lead to selfperpetuating negative beliefs about patients with OUD. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="card-text">One variable mediating the degree of stigma toward an individual with an OUD is empathy,
                                        which might be driven if the clinician has increased personal experiences. Empathetic feelings
                                        can be achieved by taking the patient's perspective. In a
                                        clinical context, empathy refers to the physician's ability to understand a patient's emotional
                                        state, its surrounding circumstance, and then reflect such understanding back to the patient.
                                        Empathic physicians are able to communicate and listen with greater reflective tendency than
                                        those who aren't (24). Research has demonstrated that improved
                                        communication between physician and patient, of which empathy is a critical component, is
                                        associated with better adherence to medications, fewer physician mistakes, and greater patient
                                        satisfaction (9). Unfortunately, empathy has been found to decrease as one
                                        progresses through medical training (10; 11)

                                        patient presentations. Many clinicians identify with valorized medical ideals, such as saving lives
                                        and healing, which can be complicated by repeated difficult presentations of these patients.
                                        OUD, depending on its acuity, might challenge these ideals and a clinician's sense of feeling
                                        helpful to their patients.

                                        solidified. It is indubitable that these opinions and perspectives of senior clinicians impact
                                        younger clinicians' views. This is called the “hidden curriculum” of medical training: the
                                        unspoken attitudes and small details that supervising physicians convey when engaging with
