          <p class="card-text">
            The majority of persons who inject opioids have a history of trauma either inflicted by others (e.g.
            physical, psychological, sexual, or emotional abuse, neglect, war, poverty, racism) or self-inflicted (i.e.
            physical trauma secondary to repeated drug use). The medical sequelae (e.g. skin abscess, endocarditis,
            cellulitis) and trauma (e.g. overdose, withdrawal) associated with injection drug use lead many PWID to
            seek care in hospital.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            Trauma-informed care (TIC) is an approach that clinicians might use in order to respectfully meet these
            patients where they are regarding their comfort, trust, and openness toward their healthcare
            experience. One study demonstrated improvements in medical students’ perceived knowledge and
            comfort in treating sexual assault survivors following completion of a TIC module. Another study found
            patients reported a more trusting partnership with physicians who underwent TIC training compared to
            physicians who did not.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            TIC involves five core principles: patient empowerment, choice, collaboration, safety, and
            trustworthiness.
